# FAT12inC
This is a simple version of FAT12 system in C.  
  
You can see all the declaraions of functions and global variables in `view.h`. 
And `top.c` `middle.c` `bottom.c` respectively provide the implementations of the __top__, __middle__ and __bottom__ modules of the FAT12 system while `main.c` and `test.img` are for testing.

## Note
This is an assignment for my os class and anybody can refer to this work for your practice.   
  
But please just do not copy the whole projects directly. My motivation is to provide a possible version for anyone who has difficulty in finishing the whole system on their own.
